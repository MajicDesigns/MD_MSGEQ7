The seven band graphic equalizer IC is a CMOS chip that divides the audio spectrum into seven bands, 63Hz, 160Hz, 400Hz, 1kHz, 2.5kHz, 6.25kHz and 16kHz. The seven frequencies are peak detected and multiplexed to the output to provide a DC representation of the amplitude of each band. The multiplexor is controlled by a reset and a strobe, permitting multiplexor readout with only two pins.

This library implements functions that allow the IC to be controlled and the data read into an internal buffer, from which it can be conveniently accessed.
